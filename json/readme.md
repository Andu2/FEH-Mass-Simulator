## HERO SKILLS TABLE - hero_skill.json

Joins many-to-many relationship between heroes and their natural skills

Make sure to include all skills and prerequisites for each hero

I (Andy) had created a database updating tool for my own personal use that took care of this (examples in old_resoure folder)

## SKILLS TABLE - skill.json

Inheritrule can be multiple traits separated by commas

ex: melee,physical (for Galeforce)

affectsduel determines whether a skill is shown if "show only skills that affect duel" is selected

## SKILL PREREQS TABLE - skill_prereq.json

Joins many-to-many relationship between skills and prerequisites

Good luck manually updating this shit (I (Jason) might kill this table and combine it into skills table...)

I (Andy) had created a database updater for my own personal use to handle this (examples in old_resoure folder)
