2017-3-24:
	Finished first draft. Known issues: 
	-Unsure of which skills healers can learn
	-Boons and banes all 3HP, but some heroes have random 4HP boons/banes and I don't trust the sources to be accurate yet on which ones they are
	-Rounding errors
	-Unsure of whether Renewal acts before Defiant skills
	-No debuffs input...mostly because I didn't realize I needed it separate from buffs until I has already made everything fit nicely!
	-Images are terrible resolution

2017-3-16:
	Started project.
