	-Can now see overkill

	-Fixed gigantic issue with debuffs not being calculated properly that I'm astonished nobody noticed. 
		As I understand it, debuffs are only taken off after a unit does its turn.
		If a unit is debuffed after attacking and gets attacked on the next turn, it's still debuffed when it gets to attack again.

2017-3-24:
	Finished first draft. Known issues: 
	-Unsure of which skills healers can learn
	-Boons and banes all 3HP, but some heroes have random 4HP boons/banes and I don't trust the sources to be accurate yet on which ones they are
	-Rounding errors
	-Unsure of whether Renewal acts before Defiant skills
	-No debuffs input...mostly because I didn't realize I needed it separate from buffs until I has already made everything fit nicely!
	-Images are terrible resolution

2017-3-16:
	Started project.
